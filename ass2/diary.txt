Got Bleats to appear working somewhat
Figured a way to change profile picture and cover picture
Info appearing in url issues fixed had a form that was not closed thats why
Got profile text working
Got delete account working 90% unable to delete directory dont know why its not working 
Seems like thats all I can do in this assignment my brain is not working properly

Stuff I have managed to get done so far is
Display User Information & Bleats
Interface
Logging In & Out
Search for Users By Username (unable to do full name)
Sending Bleats (works alright but at times produces duplicates)
Displaying Relevant Bleats
Bleat responses
User Account Creation
Profile Text (ommited HTML since its debatable what is safe and what is not)
Change Password
Uploading & Deleting Images (pro pic & cover pic)
Editing Information
Deleting Bleats (works at times sometimes deletes the wrong bleat)
Deleting Bitter Account

Thats all and for advanced features maybe we can include security
